# YouTube Clone
## Overview
This project is a clone of YouTube's main page, created as part of a learning exercise to enhance my skills in HTML and CSS. The focus was on building a responsive layout using Grid and Flexbox, implementing semantic HTML, and optimizing for SEO.

## Key Learnings

### HTML and Semantic HTML
- **Structure and Semantics:**
  - Gained a deep understanding of HTML and its semantic elements to create a well-structured, accessible layout. This involved learning how to use tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and `<main>` to improve the document structure and SEO.

### CSS Fundamentals
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox:**
  - Learned to implement CSS Grid and Flexbox to build responsive layouts that adapt fluidly to different screen sizes.
  - Successfully created a responsive design for the desktop version, ensuring elements adjust correctly when resizing the browser window.

### Responsive Design Challenges
- **Search Bar Adjustment:**
  - Currently working on adjusting the search bar for mobile devices. Encountered challenges but continuously learning and experimenting with CSS media queries to solve this issue.

### Learning Process
- **Example-Based Learning:**
  - Improved skills by studying examples and replicating them. This hands-on approach helped in understanding how different CSS properties and HTML elements work together to create a cohesive design.

### Web Development Best Practices
- **Code Organization:**
  - Structured CSS files efficiently, using comments and sections for better readability and maintainability.

### Version Control with Git
- **Git Workflow:**
  - Managed the project using Git. Learned to add and commit changes regularly, and eventually pushed the local repository to GitHub Pages for hosting.

### SEO Principles
